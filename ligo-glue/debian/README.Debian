Note that the dependencies for the python3-ligo-glue-* packages are somewhat
different from the python-ligo-glue-* packages because python3-m2crypto and
python3-cjson do not exist. However, most of ligo-glue doesn't need them.
Consider making m2crypto and cjson recommended rather than required
dependencies.
